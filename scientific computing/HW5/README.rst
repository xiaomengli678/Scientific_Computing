The lower-level directory includes all the required codes and report for HW5.

All of the analysis include a feeder whose location will be changing with time. 

- The HW5 report is in the directory HW5 and it is called HW5_Report.pdf. You can also 
  find it in the folder called Report. The name is the same. Note that since this time I did  
  homework with Microsoft Word so there are not many other files.

- The Codes for this HW5 are divided into three parts. Folder Birds, predator and Smelly Bird.
  
  Folder Birds has all the MATLAB codes for the analysis of five birds including one of them is leader and 
  the other four are following the leader.
  
  Folder Smelly Bird has all the MATLAB codes for the analysis of six birds including one of them is leader,
  one of them is smelly bird and the other four are following the leader and strongly repelled by the smelly bird.
  
  Folder predator has all the MATLAB codes for the analysis of five birds including one of them is leader and 
  the other four are following the leader. All of five birds are effected by the force from a predator whose 
  location will be changing with time.
  
- In oder to implement the codes, please go to each folder and open the mathhw5.m with MATLAB. Click Run. The videos will be 
  made for each of the three cases. If you want to watch the video directly, please open the myVideo.avi. They were all produced by MATLAB.
